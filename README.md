## 1. Info
Timer script created for Vue.js speedcubing timer app I'm working on.

Click [here](https://codepen.io/pawelkaczoruk/pen/bGNyLwr) to see example code and test it.

## 2. How timer works:
* Hold spacebar for at least 550ms - until timer turns green (550ms is standard delay of stackmat timers that are used in professional speedcubing competitions)
* If you held spacebar down for less than 550ms the timer will go back to initial state
* When spacebar was held down for at least 550ms and spacebar was released - timer will begin to count
* Stop timer by pressing spacebar
